## One Vault

One vault was a project for one of my programming coursed. It is a password and credential manager. After logging in, users can store their personal information on the platform. It was made using nextjs for the frontend and supabase for the backend. The project was written almost exclusively in JavaScript.
Since this project needed to be finished within two weeks, I wasn't able to implement everything I wanted to, including properly encripting the credentials in the database.
